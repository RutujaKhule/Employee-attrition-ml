📌 Employee Attrition Prediction App

A Machine Learning web application built using Streamlit that predicts whether an employee is at risk of leaving the company based on basic attributes like age, service length, gender, and department.

🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze employee data and predict attrition risk. The app provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input employee details and instantly receive predictions.
